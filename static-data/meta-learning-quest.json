        "body": "Learning works the same way across subjects. Languages, math, programming, philosophy, and music all rely on the same underlying processes.\n\nBy choosing a concrete learning target, you give your brain something specific to work on. The process you practice here will transfer to other skills later.\n\nThis quest is not about what you learn. It is about how you learn anything."

        "body": "Focused attention is when you deliberately concentrate on one problem or idea. This is where you build initial understanding and form the raw pieces of knowledge.\n\nFocused work feels effortful and slow. That is normal. If learning feels easy, you are often just recognizing information, not building it.\n\nFocused mode is necessary, but it is not sufficient on its own."

        "body": "When you step away, your brain continues working in the background. This relaxed state is often where connections form and insights appear.\n\nWalking, resting, showering, or doing light physical tasks all help activate this mode. Consuming new content usually does not.\n\nLearning improves when you deliberately alternate between focused effort and relaxed disengagement."

        "body": "Actively trying to recall what you learned strengthens memory far more than rereading or reviewing notes.\n\nStruggle during recall is a good sign. It means your brain is rebuilding the knowledge instead of passively recognizing it.\n\nGetting things wrong here is useful information, not failure."

        "title": "Awareness prevents false confidence",
        "body": "Your brain is very good at feeling like it understands something when it does not. This is called an illusion of competence.\n\nReflection helps you notice gaps, confusion, and unexpected difficulty. It trains you to judge learning by performance, not comfort.\n\nGood learners pay attention to what feels hard and unclear, not just what feels smooth."
