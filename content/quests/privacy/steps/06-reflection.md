# Your Privacy Strategy

You've now learned about:

- How public chain transparency works
- What data is and isn't public
- The hard limits of privacy on transparent ledgers
- How to build a personal threat model
- Concrete security best practices

## Putting It Together

The goal isn't perfect privacy — it's **intentional privacy**. You should now be able to:

1. **Know your exposure**: Understand what's visible about your on-chain activity
2. **Prioritize threats**: Focus on the risks that matter most to you
3. **Take action**: Implement the security practices that address your top threats
4. **Stay realistic**: Understand what privacy tools can and can't do

## Next Steps

Consider these ongoing practices:

- **Review your threat model periodically** as your on-chain activity changes
- **Stay updated** on new privacy tools and chain analysis techniques
- **Share knowledge** with others who might benefit (while respecting their privacy)
- **Practice wallet hygiene** — separate wallets for separate purposes

Remember: privacy is a practice, not a product. It's something you maintain over time, not something you set up once and forget.
