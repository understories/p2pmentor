# Privacy on Public Chains

Public blockchains like Ethereum are **transparent by design**. Every transaction ever made is permanently recorded and visible to anyone in the world.

This is a feature, not a bug — transparency enables trustless verification. But it also means your financial activity is public unless you take deliberate steps to protect your privacy.

## Why This Matters

When you use Ethereum, the following is **publicly visible**:

- Your wallet address
- Every transaction you've ever made
- Your token balances
- Which smart contracts you've interacted with
- How much ETH or tokens you've sent and received

What's **not** automatically public:

- Your real-world identity (unless you link it)
- Your IP address (unless your RPC provider logs it)
- Why you made a transaction

## The Privacy Paradox

Blockchain promises financial sovereignty, but without privacy practices, you may be revealing more about your financial life than you would with a traditional bank account.

**Key insight:** Privacy on public chains is not about hiding — it's about controlling what information is linked to your identity.
