# Privacy & Security Checklist

Now that you understand the privacy landscape and have a threat model, it's time to review concrete security practices.

## How to Use This Checklist

Go through each item and check off the ones you've **already implemented**. This isn't about doing everything right now — it's about knowing where you stand and what to prioritize next.

The items are grouped by category:

- **Wallet Security**: How you store and manage your keys
- **Transaction Safety**: How you interact with contracts and send transactions
- **Identity Protection**: How you manage the link between your address and identity
- **Operational Security**: Day-to-day habits that protect your privacy

## Important Notes

- You don't need to do everything. Focus on what matters for your threat model.
- This is **opt-in only** — you choose what to share.
- Your checklist completion is stored as evidence of your security awareness, not as proof of specific security measures.

Complete at least 5 items to finish this step.
