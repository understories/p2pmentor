# Verify on Explorer

## Why Verify?

In traditional apps, you have to trust the company's servers. With Arkiv, you can **verify independently** that your data exists on-chain.

The **Arkiv Explorer** is a public tool that lets anyone view entities and transactions on the blockchain - no trust required.

## Finding Your Entity

1. **Get your transaction hash** from when you created the entity
2. **Open the Arkiv Explorer**: [https://explorer.mendoza.hoodi.arkiv.network](https://explorer.mendoza.hoodi.arkiv.network)
3. **Search for your transaction hash** in the search bar
4. **View your entity** - You should see:
   - Your entity key
   - The transaction hash
   - The attributes you set
   - The payload data

## What You're Seeing

When you view your entity on the Explorer, you're seeing:
- **On-chain proof** that the data exists
- **Immutable record** - The transaction can't be changed
- **Public verification** - Anyone can verify it independently

This is what "trustless" means - you don't need to trust our servers because you can verify on-chain.

## Try It Now

1. If you created an entity in the previous step, find its transaction hash
2. Open the Mendoza Explorer
3. Search for your transaction hash
4. Verify that your entity appears with the correct data

## The Power of Verification

This is a fundamental difference from traditional apps:
- **Traditional**: "Trust us, your data is in our database"
- **Arkiv**: "Here's the transaction hash - verify it yourself on the blockchain"

You don't need to trust anyone. The blockchain provides cryptographic proof.
