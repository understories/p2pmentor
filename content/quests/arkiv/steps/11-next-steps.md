## Key Takeaways

**Data Sovereignty**
- You own your data
- It lives on-chain, not in company databases
- It persists independently of apps

**Trustless Verification**
- Anyone can verify data exists
- No need to trust servers
- Blockchain provides cryptographic proof

**Composability**
- Multiple apps can read the same data
- Build on top of existing data
- Create interoperable ecosystems

**Serverless Architecture**
- No central database needed
- Apps are just viewers/coordinators
- Data layer is shared and decentralized
