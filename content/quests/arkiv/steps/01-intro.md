# Welcome to Arkiv

## What You'll Learn

In this track, you'll learn to build decentralized applications with Arkiv. By the end, you'll be able to:

- Create entities (data records) on Arkiv
- Query and retrieve your data
- Verify your data on-chain using the Explorer
- Understand the "walkaway test" for data independence

## What is Arkiv?

Arkiv is a decentralized database for the web. Instead of storing your data in a company's database (where it can be lost, censored, or locked in), Arkiv stores data on-chain.

**Key properties:**
- **You own your data** - It's tied to your wallet, not a company account
- **Data persists independently** - Even if an app shuts down, your data remains
- **Verifiable** - Anyone can verify data exists without trusting servers
- **Composable** - Multiple apps can read the same data

## Traditional Apps vs Arkiv

| Traditional Apps | Arkiv Apps |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Data in company database | Data on-chain |
| Lost if company shuts down | Persists forever |
| Trust the company | Verify on-chain |
| Locked to one app | Composable across apps |

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript
