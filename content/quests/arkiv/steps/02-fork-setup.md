# Fork and Clone the Starter

## Getting Started

The fastest way to learn Arkiv is by building with it. We'll use the **arkiv-nextjs-starter** as our foundation.

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. **Go to the arkiv-nextjs-starter repository**
   - Visit: [https://github.com/arkiv-network/arkiv-nextjs-starter](https://github.com/arkiv-network/arkiv-nextjs-starter)
   - Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
   - This creates your own copy of the starter

## Step 2: Clone Your Fork

1. **Copy the repository URL** from your forked repository
2. **Clone it locally:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/arkiv-nextjs-starter.git
   cd arkiv-nextjs-starter
   ```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

## What You're Getting

The starter includes:
- **Next.js** setup with TypeScript
- **Arkiv SDK** already configured
- **Example entity creation** code
- **Query examples** for reading data
- **Basic UI** to interact with Arkiv

## Verify Installation

Check that everything installed correctly:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see the Next.js dev server start. We'll configure it properly in the next step.

## Why Fork?

Forking gives you:
- Your own copy to experiment with
- Ability to push changes and save your work
- A starting point for your own Arkiv app

## Next Steps

Once you've forked and cloned, you're ready to configure your environment variables. Click "Mark as Complete" to continue.
