# What is Artificial Intelligence?

## Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science focused on building systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence — recognizing patterns, making decisions, understanding language, and generating content.

## AI vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

These terms are often used interchangeably, but they are nested concepts:

- **Artificial Intelligence** — the broadest category. Any system that exhibits intelligent behavior.
- **Machine Learning (ML)** — a subset of AI. Systems that learn from data rather than being explicitly programmed.
- **Deep Learning** — a subset of ML. Uses neural networks with many layers to learn complex patterns.

**Key insight:** Most modern AI breakthroughs are deep learning systems trained on massive datasets.

## What You'll Learn

In this track, you'll explore:

- **Neural Networks** — how machines learn from data
- **Training Algorithms** — gradient descent, backpropagation, and loss functions
- **Large Language Models** — how GPT, Claude, and similar systems work
- **Generative AI** — how AI creates text, images, and code
- **Ethics & Limitations** — what AI can't do and where it goes wrong
- **AI + Web3** — how decentralized systems can make AI more transparent

## Why It Matters for Web3

AI and blockchain are converging:

- On-chain provenance for training data and model outputs
- Decentralized compute for model training and inference
- Verifiable AI — proving what a model did and why
- Smart contracts that interact with AI oracles

Understanding AI fundamentals helps you evaluate these intersections critically.
