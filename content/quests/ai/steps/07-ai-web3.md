# AI Meets Web3

## The Intersection

AI and decentralized systems address complementary problems. AI excels at pattern recognition and generation; blockchain excels at verification and provenance.

## Verifiable AI

One of the biggest challenges with AI is trust: how do you know what a model was trained on, or that its output wasn't tampered with?

Blockchain can help by providing:

- **Training data provenance** — recording what data a model was trained on
- **Output attestation** — timestamping and signing model outputs
- **Audit trails** — immutable records of model behavior over time

## Decentralized Compute

Training and running AI models requires significant compute. Decentralized compute networks distribute this across many providers:

- No single point of failure
- Censorship-resistant model hosting
- Market-driven pricing for inference

## On-Chain AI Artifacts

Just as p2pmentor stores learning evidence on Arkiv, AI artifacts can be stored on-chain:

- Model output hashes for verification
- Training data fingerprints
- Inference request/response records

This creates **verifiable AI** — anyone can check what happened without trusting a central server.

## AI Agents and Smart Contracts

AI agents can interact with smart contracts to:

- Execute transactions based on learned policies
- Manage decentralized governance proposals
- Automate DeFi strategies with learned risk models

## The Bigger Picture

The combination of AI and Web3 points toward a future where:

- AI systems are **auditable** (you can verify what they did)
- Training data is **transparent** (you can see what they learned from)
- Model outputs are **verifiable** (you don't have to trust the operator)
- Compute is **decentralized** (no single company controls access)

This aligns with the same principles that drive p2pmentor: transparency, verifiability, and user ownership.
