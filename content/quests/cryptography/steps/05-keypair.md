# Create Your Keypair

## Public and Private Keys

A keypair consists of:
- **Private Key:** Secret, never share (like a password)
- **Public Key:** Public, share freely (like your address)

## Key Relationship

- Private key can **sign** messages
- Public key can **verify** signatures
- Can't derive private key from public key
- Can't sign with public key

## Generate Your Keypair

[Interactive component to generate keypair client-side]

**Important Security Notes:**
- Private key is generated in your browser (never sent to server)
- Private key is shown once (copy it if you want to save it)
- Public key can be shared safely
- Never share your private key!

## Your Keypair

## Save Your Keys

- **Public Key:** Safe to save anywhere (you'll need it for verification)
- **Private Key:** Save securely (password manager, encrypted file)

## Practice

1. Generate a keypair
2. Copy your public key (you'll use it in the next step)
3. Save your private key securely

Your public key will be stored in your progress (private key is never stored).
