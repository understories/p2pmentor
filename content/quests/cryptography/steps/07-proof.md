# Create a Cryptographic Proof

## What is a Proof?

A cryptographic proof demonstrates you understand and can use cryptography. You'll create a proof artifact that can be verified.

## Your Proof Options

Choose one to create:

1. **Hash Proof:** Hash a meaningful message and submit the hash
2. **Signature Proof:** Sign a message and submit message + signature + public key
3. **Keypair Proof:** Generate a keypair and submit public key fingerprint

## Proof Requirements

Your proof must include:
- **Type:** Hash, Signature, or Keypair
- **Artifact:** The cryptographic output
- **Context:** What it proves (e.g., "Hash of my learning commitment")

## Example Proof

**Type:** Signature Proof

**Message:**
```
"I completed the cryptography quest on [date]"
```

**Public Key:**
```
[Your public key]
```

**Signature:**
```
[Your signature]
```

**Verification:** Anyone can verify this signature with your public key!

## Submit Your Proof

[Submission form]

Enter:
- Proof type
- Artifact (hash/signature/public key)
- Context/description

## Why This Matters

Creating proofs demonstrates:
- You understand the concepts
- You can use the tools
- You can create verifiable evidence
