# What is Cryptography?

## Introduction

Cryptography is the practice of securing information by transforming it into a form that only authorized parties can understand. In this quest, you'll learn the fundamentals that power modern digital security.

## What You'll Learn

- **Hashing:** Creating unique fingerprints of data
- **Digital Signatures:** Proving authenticity without revealing secrets
- **Keypairs:** Public and private keys for secure communication
- **Verification:** How to verify cryptographic proofs

## Why It Matters

Cryptography is everywhere:
- **Blockchain:** Transactions are secured with cryptographic signatures
- **HTTPS:** Your web browsing is encrypted
- **Passwords:** Stored as hashes, not plain text
- **Digital Identity:** Proves who you are without revealing private information

## Key Concepts

**Encryption vs Hashing:**
- Encryption is reversible (you can decrypt)
- Hashing is one-way (you can't reverse it)

**Public vs Private Keys:**
- Public key: Share with everyone (like your address)
- Private key: Keep secret (like your house key)
