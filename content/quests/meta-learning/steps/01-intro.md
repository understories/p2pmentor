# What is Meta-Learning?

## Introduction

Meta-learning is "learning how to learn" - understanding the science and techniques that make learning more effective, efficient, and enjoyable.

## Why Meta-Learning Matters

Most people never learn how to learn. They use the same study methods from high school:
- Re-reading notes
- Highlighting textbooks
- Cramming before exams

But research shows these methods are **ineffective**. Meta-learning teaches you evidence-based techniques that actually work.

## What You'll Learn

In this quest, you'll master:

1. **Memory Science:** How memory actually works
2. **Spaced Repetition:** The most effective review schedule
3. **Deliberative Practice:** How experts get better
4. **Procedural Learning:** Making skills automatic
5. **Active Recall:** Testing yourself to strengthen memory

## The Learning Paradox

The harder learning feels, the better you're learning. Easy learning (re-reading, highlighting) feels productive but doesn't stick. Hard learning (testing yourself, spaced practice) feels difficult but creates lasting knowledge.

## Key Principle

**Retrieval > Recognition > Re-exposure**

- **Re-exposure** (re-reading): Feels easy, weak memory
- **Recognition** (multiple choice): Moderate memory
- **Retrieval** (recall from memory): Feels hard, strong memory
