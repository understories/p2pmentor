# Understanding Memory

## How Memory Works

Memory isn't like a filing cabinet where you store information. It's a **process** of encoding, storage, and retrieval.

## The Three Stages of Memory

### 1. Encoding
- Information enters your brain
- Attention and focus matter
- Meaningful connections help

### 2. Storage
- Information is stored in neural networks
- Connections between neurons strengthen
- Sleep is crucial for consolidation

### 3. Retrieval
- Accessing stored information
- Each retrieval strengthens the memory
- Context matters (where/how you learned)

## The Forgetting Curve

Hermann Ebbinghaus discovered that we forget information rapidly:
- **1 hour:** Forget ~50%
- **1 day:** Forget ~70%
- **1 week:** Forget ~90%

**But:** Each time you retrieve information, the forgetting curve resets and becomes flatter.

## Types of Memory

### Working Memory
- Holds ~7 items for ~20 seconds
- Limited capacity
- Used for active thinking

### Long-Term Memory
- Unlimited capacity
- Permanent storage
- Requires encoding and retrieval practice

### Procedural Memory
- "How to" knowledge (riding a bike, typing)
- Becomes automatic through practice
- Hard to forget once learned

## Memory Strengthening

Memory gets stronger through:
1. **Retrieval practice** (testing yourself)
2. **Spacing** (review over time)
3. **Interleaving** (mixing topics)
4. **Elaboration** (connecting to existing knowledge)

## The Testing Effect

Testing yourself doesn't just measure learning - it **creates** learning. Each time you retrieve information, you strengthen the memory pathway.

## Key Insight

**Forgetting is normal. The solution isn't to prevent forgetting - it's to practice retrieval regularly.**

## Next Step

You'll learn about spaced repetition - the most effective way to schedule retrieval practice.
