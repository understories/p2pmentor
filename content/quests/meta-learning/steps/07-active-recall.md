# Active Recall

## What is Active Recall?

Active recall is retrieving information from memory without looking at the source. Instead of re-reading notes, you test yourself.

## Why It Works

Research consistently shows active recall beats passive review:
- **Re-reading:** Feels productive, weak memory
- **Active recall:** Feels difficult, strong memory

The **testing effect** shows that testing yourself creates learning, not just measures it.

## How Active Recall Works

### Traditional Study Method
1. Read notes
2. Highlight important parts
3. Re-read highlighted parts
4. Feel like you know it
5. Forget it quickly

### Active Recall Method
1. Read notes once
2. Close the notes
3. Write/say what you remember
4. Check notes for what you missed
5. Repeat
6. Remember it long-term

## Types of Active Recall

### 1. Free Recall
- Write everything you remember about a topic
- No prompts or hints
- Most challenging, most effective

### 2. Cued Recall
- Use prompts or questions
- "What are the three stages of memory?"
- Easier than free recall, still effective

### 3. Recognition
- Multiple choice questions
- "Which of these is correct?"
- Easiest, least effective (but still better than re-reading)

## Creating Recall Questions

Good recall questions:
- **Test understanding, not memorization**
- **Require explanation, not just facts**
- **Connect concepts**
- **Apply knowledge**

Examples:
- ❌ "What is the capital of France?" (just memorization)
- ✅ "Explain why Paris became the capital of France" (understanding)
- ❌ "What is spaced repetition?" (definition)
- ✅ "Design a spaced repetition schedule for learning Spanish" (application)

## The Feynman Technique

A powerful active recall method:

1. **Choose a concept** you want to learn
2. **Explain it simply** (as if to a child)
3. **Identify gaps** in your explanation
4. **Review the material** to fill gaps
5. **Simplify and repeat**

## Practice Tips

- **Test yourself frequently** - don't wait until you "know it"
- **Space out your recall** - don't do it all at once
- **Mix topics** - interleaving strengthens memory
- **Explain out loud** - speaking activates different brain pathways
- **Use flashcards** - but make your own (creating them is active recall)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Looking at answers too quickly** - struggle first
2. **Only doing easy questions** - push yourself
3. **Doing it all at once** - space it out
4. **Not explaining** - just listing facts

## Key Insight

**The difficulty of active recall is a feature, not a bug. The struggle to retrieve information is what strengthens memory.**
