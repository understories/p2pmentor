# Procedural Learning

## What is Procedural Learning?

Procedural learning is learning "how to do" something - skills that become automatic through practice. Examples:
- Typing
- Riding a bike
- Playing an instrument
- Coding syntax
- Speaking a language

## Characteristics

### 1. Becomes Automatic
- You don't think about each step
- Your body/mind "knows" what to do
- Can do it while thinking about other things

### 2. Hard to Explain
- "How do you ride a bike?" → Hard to describe
- "How do you type?" → Hard to explain finger positions
- You just "know" how to do it

### 3. Resistant to Forgetting
- Once learned, hard to forget
- "Like riding a bike" - you never forget
- Even after years, comes back quickly

## How Procedural Learning Works

### Stage 1: Cognitive
- Think through each step
- Slow and deliberate
- Make many mistakes
- Need instructions

### Stage 2: Associative
- Steps become smoother
- Fewer mistakes
- Less thinking required
- Still need some attention

### Stage 3: Automatic
- Flows naturally
- Minimal thinking
- Can multitask
- Hard to break down into steps

## Examples

### Learning to Type
- **Stage 1:** Look at keyboard, find each letter, type slowly
- **Stage 2:** Type without looking, occasional mistakes
- **Stage 3:** Type automatically, think about content not keys

### Learning to Code
- **Stage 1:** Look up syntax, think about each line
- **Stage 2:** Remember common patterns, write faster
- **Stage 3:** Syntax is automatic, focus on logic

## How to Accelerate Procedural Learning

1. **Massed Practice First:** Do it many times in a row
2. **Get Immediate Feedback:** Know if you did it right
3. **Practice Variations:** Don't just repeat the same thing
4. **Sleep:** Consolidation happens during sleep
5. **Gradual Complexity:** Start simple, add complexity

## The Power of Sleep

Sleep is crucial for procedural learning:
- Practice during the day
- Sleep consolidates the skill
- Wake up better than when you went to sleep
- This is why "sleep on it" works

## Key Insight

**Procedural skills require practice, not just understanding. You can't learn to type by reading about typing - you have to type.**

## Next Step

You'll learn about active recall - the most effective way to strengthen declarative (factual) memory.
