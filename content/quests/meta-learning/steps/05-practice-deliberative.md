## Step 5: Create Practice Plan

Your deliberative practice plan:

**Skill:** [selected skill]
**Focus Component:** [selected component]

**Duration:** [recommended: 30-60 minutes]
**Frequency:** [recommended: daily or every other day]

## Tips for Success

- **Start small:** 20-30 minutes is enough
- **Be specific:** Vague goals = vague results
- **Get feedback:** Can't improve without knowing what's wrong
- **Push yourself:** Comfort zone = no growth
- **Reflect:** After practice, note what worked and what didn't
