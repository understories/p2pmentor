## Step 4: Review and Improve

After answering, review your notes and:

- Note what you need to review more

## Tips for Effective Questions

- **Make them hard** - if they're too easy, you're not learning
- **Require explanation** - not just "yes/no" or single words
- **Test connections** - how concepts relate to each other
- **Apply knowledge** - use it in new contexts
