# Spaced Repetition

## What is Spaced Repetition?

Spaced repetition is reviewing information at increasing intervals. Instead of cramming, you review:
- Soon after learning (1 day)
- Then later (3 days)
- Then even later (1 week)
- Then much later (2 weeks)
- And so on...

## Why It Works

Each time you retrieve information, you reset the forgetting curve. Spacing reviews out:
- Makes retrieval harder (which strengthens memory)
- Prevents over-learning (waste of time)
- Maximizes long-term retention

## The Spacing Effect

Research shows spaced practice beats massed practice (cramming):
- **Massed practice:** 10 hours in one day = weak memory
- **Spaced practice:** 10 hours over 10 days = strong memory

## Creating Your Schedule

Use this formula for spaced repetition:

1. **First review:** 1 day after learning
2. **Second review:** 3 days after first review
3. **Third review:** 1 week after second review
4. **Fourth review:** 2 weeks after third review
5. **Fifth review:** 1 month after fourth review

After that, review when you feel you're about to forget.

## Practice: Create a Spaced Repetition Schedule

Choose a concept you want to learn (e.g., "How blockchain works", "Spanish vocabulary", "React hooks").

Create your review schedule using the tool below:

## Tips

- **Use a calendar** or spaced repetition app (Anki, SuperMemo)
- **Don't skip reviews** - consistency matters
- **Adjust intervals** based on difficulty (harder concepts = shorter intervals)
- **Trust the process** - it feels slow but works
