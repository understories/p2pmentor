# Feedback and Learning Loops

Feedback is permanent, contextual, and attributable. It is not anonymous and not editable.

## Session feedback

`session_feedback` entities keyed by session. Users can leave structured feedback on sessions. Feedback stored on Arkiv for future analysis and learning.

## App feedback

`app_feedback` entities for general UX feedback. Developer experience feedback tracked in [`docs/dx_arkiv_runbook.md`](../../../dx_arkiv_runbook.md). DX metrics stored as `dx_metric` entities on Arkiv.

## Builder feedback

Developer experience with Arkiv tracked in [`docs/dx_arkiv_runbook.md`](../../../dx_arkiv_runbook.md). Pain points and improvements feed back into Arkiv SDK and examples.
