# Getting Started Tutorial

A step-by-step guide for new users to get started with p2pmentor.

## Step 1: Get Your Beta Code

When you first visit p2pmentor, you'll need a beta invite code. This helps us manage the beta and prevent abuse.

1. Go to the beta page (`/beta`)
2. Enter your invite code
3. Click "Enter Beta"

Your beta access is stored in your browser, so you won't need to enter it again.

## Step 2: Connect Your Wallet

p2pmentor uses your wallet address as your identity. You have two options:

**Option A: MetaMask (Recommended)**
1. Install MetaMask browser extension if you don't have it
2. Click "Connect with MetaMask" on the auth page
3. Approve the connection in MetaMask
4. If Mendoza testnet isn't added, you'll be prompted to add it automatically

**Option B: Passkey (No Wallet Extension Needed)**
1. Click "Login with Passkey" on the auth page
2. Use your device's biometric authentication (fingerprint, face ID, etc.)
3. A wallet is automatically created for you

**Important:** This is a testnet. Wallets and passkeys are for identity and signing only. No real funds are required or expected.

## Step 3: Create Your Profile

After connecting your wallet, you'll be taken to onboarding. The first step is creating your identity.

1. **Choose Your Display Name**
   - This is how others will see you on the platform
   - You can change it later

2. **Write a Short Bio**
   - Tell others what you're exploring or learning
   - Keep it brief (this is your "exploring statement")

3. **Select Your Timezone**
   - This helps with scheduling sessions
   - Automatically detected from your browser, but you can change it

4. Click "Create Profile"

Your profile is now stored on Arkiv blockchain. You can view it on the Arkiv explorer using the "View on Arkiv" link.

## Step 4: Add Your Skills

Skills help others find you and help you find mentors or learners.

1. **Browse Available Skills**
   - Skills are organized by category
   - You can search for specific skills

2. **Add Skills You're Learning**
   - Click on skills you want to learn
   - Set your expertise level (0-5) for each skill
   - Level 0 means you're just starting
   - Level 5 means you're an expert

3. **Add Skills You Can Teach**
   - Same process, but these are skills you can offer to teach
   - You can have the same skill in both categories

4. Click "Save Skills"

Your skills are now part of your profile and visible to others.

## Step 5: Choose Your Path

The onboarding flow lets you choose what you want to do first:

**Path 1: I Want to Learn (Create an Ask)**
- Post what you want to learn
- Others who can teach will see it
- Great for finding mentors

**Path 2: I Want to Teach (Create an Offer)**
- Post what you can teach
- Others who want to learn will see it
- Great for finding learners

**Path 3: Explore the Network**
- Browse existing asks and offers
- See the mentorship network visualization
- Find connections without posting first

**Path 4: Join a Community**
- Join skill-based communities
- Connect with others learning the same skills
- Participate in group learning

You can do all of these later, but choosing a path helps you get started quickly.

## Step 6: Create Your First Ask or Offer

**If you chose "I Want to Learn":**

1. Select a skill you want to learn
2. Write a message explaining what you want to learn
   - Be specific: "I want to learn how to write smart contracts in Solidity"
   - Include context: "I'm a JavaScript developer looking to transition to Web3"
3. Click "Create Ask"
4. Your ask is now visible on the network page

**If you chose "I Want to Teach":**

1. Select a skill you can teach
2. Write a message explaining what you can offer
   - Be specific: "I can teach Solidity smart contract development"
   - Include your approach: "I prefer hands-on sessions with code examples"
3. Click "Create Offer"
4. Your offer is now visible on the network page

**Important:** Asks and offers expire after a set time (default 24 hours for asks, 48 hours for offers). You can create new ones anytime.

## Step 7: Find Matches

Once you've created an ask or offer, you can find matches:

1. **Go to the Network Page** (`/network`)
   - This shows all asks and offers in the system
   - You can filter by skill

2. **View Potential Matches**
   - If you created an ask, you'll see offers that match your skill
   - If you created an offer, you'll see asks that match your skill
   - Matches are highlighted

3. **View Profiles**
   - Click on any ask or offer to see the person's profile
   - Check their skills, bio, and availability
   - See their rating and session history

4. **Browse All Profiles** (`/profiles`)
   - See everyone on the platform
   - Filter by skills, seniority, or other criteria
   - Find mentors or learners even if they haven't posted asks/offers

## Step 8: Schedule a Session

When you find someone you want to connect with:

1. **Click "Schedule Session"** on their ask or offer
   - Or go to their profile and click "Schedule Session"

2. **Fill in Session Details**
   - Select the skill you'll be working on
   - Choose a date and time
   - Set the duration (default 60 minutes)
   - Add optional notes

3. **Submit the Session Request**
   - The other person will receive a notification
   - They need to confirm the session

4. **Wait for Confirmation**
   - Both parties must confirm before the session is scheduled
   - Once confirmed, you'll get a Jitsi video link for the session

## Step 9: Join Your Session

When it's time for your session:

1. **Go to Your Sessions Page** (`/me/sessions`)
   - See all your scheduled sessions
   - Find the session you want to join

2. **Click "Join Session"**
   - This opens the Jitsi video room
   - Both parties can join when ready

3. **Have Your Session**
   - Learn, teach, and connect
   - Sessions are peer-to-peer (no recording, no central server)

## Step 10: Give Feedback

After your session:

1. **Go to Your Sessions Page**
   - Find the completed session
   - Click "Give Feedback"

2. **Rate the Session**
   - Give a rating from 1-5 stars
   - Write optional notes about what you learned or how it went

3. **Submit Feedback**
   - Your feedback is stored on Arkiv
   - It helps build trust and reputation on the platform
   - The other person's average rating is updated

## What Happens Next?

Once you've completed onboarding:

- **Your Dashboard** (`/me`) shows your stats, profile, and skills
- **Network Page** (`/network`) helps you find new connections
- **Sessions Page** (`/me/sessions`) tracks all your sessions
- **Skills Page** (`/me/skills`) lets you manage your skills
- **Availability Page** (`/me/availability`) lets you set when you're available

## Tips for Success

1. **Complete Your Profile**
   - The more complete your profile, the easier it is for others to find you
   - Add a bio, skills, and availability

2. **Be Specific in Asks and Offers**
   - Clear messages get better matches
   - Include your experience level and what you're looking for

3. **Respond Promptly**
   - When someone wants to schedule a session, respond quickly
   - This builds trust and helps connections happen

4. **Give Honest Feedback**
   - Feedback helps everyone improve
   - It also helps others decide who to connect with

5. **Explore the Network**
   - Don't just wait for matches to come to you
