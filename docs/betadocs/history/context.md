# History and Context

## Hidden Garden and early experiments

Hidden Garden as initial prototype for networked learning and mutual aid. Experiments with network visualizations, permissioned spaces, trust building and small-group governance.

## Mentor Graph

Mentor Graph as the first Arkiv-based reference implementation. Focus on basic entities for profiles, asks, offers, sessions, feedback, and DX patterns for Arkiv SDK on testnet. p2pmentor builds on these patterns while simplifying the experience for non-technical users.

## Mentor Garden vision

Long-term direction: a living, growing map of skills, mentors, learners and sessions, and a set of tools for communities to run their own mentorship networks on Arkiv. p2pmentor serves as the seed project and blueprint for other gardens, and a concrete testbed for Arkiv DX and ecosystem integrations.
