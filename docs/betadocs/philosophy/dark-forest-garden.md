# Dark Forest and Hidden Garden

## Dark forest metaphor

The open internet is noisy and adversarial. Users need safe, semi-private spaces where trust and context can grow.

## Hidden garden vision

Small, curated networks with strong norms and shared purpose. Visual language of constellations, forest, and growing light.

## p2pmentor as the garden path

First surface where people can move between dark forest and garden safely. Mentorship sessions as "lamps" that light parts of the network.
