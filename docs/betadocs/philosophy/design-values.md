# Design Values

## White-hat UX

No dark patterns, no attention traps. Clear language and consent for any data sharing.

## Calm default

Minimal notifications. Simple UI flows that reward depth, not shallow engagement.

## Composability

Prefer primitives that other builders can reuse. Every new integration considered as a potential Arkiv builder package.
