# First Principles

## Data sovereignty

Users own and control their data. The application is a client of a shared data layer, not the owner of data.

## No intermediaries in the core value flow

The platform helps people find each other and coordinate. It does not sit in the middle as the primary owner of identity, content or relationships.

## Trustless infrastructure, trustworthy UX

Infrastructure should not require trust to protect user data. UX and community norms should encourage good behavior and mutual respect.
