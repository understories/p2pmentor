## Contributing

Start with issues labelled for DX, performance or Arkiv patterns. Provide feedback or report issues directly within the app or on our public Github. 

Propose improvements to entity schemas or builder packages. Use repository discussions or issues for technical questions. Share Arkiv-specific feedback in the DX runbook format where possible.
