# Introduction

## What p2pmentor is

A focused beta of a peer to peer mentorship network built on Arkiv so that user data lives on a shared, user-owned data layer. This is the first live step from Mentor Graph prototypes toward a broader Mentor Garden ecosystem, designed for small, high trust cohorts rather than public internet scale.

## What p2pmentor is not

- Not production ready for mainnet or real funds
- Not a full mentorship marketplace or all-in-one learning platform
- Not a custodial SaaS product with a central application database
- Not an analytics-first product. Priority is trust and sovereignty, then optimized performance.

## Goals for the beta

- Validate core mentorship flows end to end
  - Create profile
  - Publish asks and offers
  - Match and schedule sessions
  - Join a call and reflect
- Validate Arkiv as the primary data layer for a real product
  - Only store what is needed off-chain (for performance or UX)
  - Make it easy for other builders to reuse our patterns and packages
- Collect structured feedback from both users and developers

## Audience

- Builders using Arkiv who want a concrete reference implementation
- Designers and PMs working on peer to peer mentorship flows
- Early mentors and learners testing the beta

## Documentation Structure

- Concept first (why), then architecture (how), then feature walkthrough (what it does)
- Arkiv-specific details collected in dedicated sections for reuse
- Beta documentation for an invite-only release
- Assumes readers are comfortable with web3 basics and TypeScript
