# History & Future

## Context

## Mentor Graph

Mentor Graph was the first Arkiv-based reference implementation. Focus on basic entities for profiles, asks, offers, sessions, feedback, and DX patterns for Arkiv SDK on testnet. p2pmentor builds on these patterns while simplifying the experience for non-technical users.

We built Mentor Graph as part of the Sub0 Hackathon in Buenos Aires in November 2025, winning first place for the Arkiv track. We are grateful to Arkiv for building technology that enables us to be trustless and serverless from day 1 and for their ongoing support in our development.

## Hidden Garden

Hidden Garden was created a week later at ETH Global Buenos Aires. It served as an initial prototype for networked learning and mutual aid. Experiments with network visualizations, permissioned spaces, trust building and small-group governance.

## Mentor Garden vision

Long-term direction: a living, growing map of skills, mentors, learners and sessions, and a set of tools for communities to run their own mentorship networks on Arkiv. p2pmentor serves as the seed project and blueprint for other gardens, and a concrete testbed for Arkiv DX and ecosystem integrations.
