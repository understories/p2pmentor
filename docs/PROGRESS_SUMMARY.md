# Development Progress Summary

**Last Updated:** Current Session  
**Status:** P2 Session Flow - In Progress

---

## ✅ Completed (P0, P1, P2 Partial)

### P0 - Core Foundations ✅
- ✅ Beta invite code system (`/beta` with "growtogether")
- ✅ Arkiv SDK setup (client & server)
- ✅ MetaMask authentication
- ✅ Example wallet login
- ✅ DX tracking document (`docs/dx_arkiv_runbook.md`)
- ✅ Local dev server running
- ✅ Architecture documentation (`docs/architecture_overview.md`)
- ⏸️ Ethereum Passkey (deferred to end of sprint)
- ⏸️ Mobile-first layout (basic structure done, needs polish)

### P1 - Core Data Flows ✅
- ✅ Profile creation (`/me/profile`) - Full CRUD with Arkiv entities
- ✅ Skills management (`/me/skills`) - Add/remove skills
- ✅ Availability (text-based, `/me/availability`)
- ✅ Asks & Offers (`/asks`, `/offers`) - Full CRUD with TTL
- ✅ Network graph with matching (`/network`) - Skill-based matching, filtering, stats

### P2 - Mentorship Session Flow ✅ (Mostly Complete)
- ✅ **Browse profiles** (`/profiles`, `/profiles/[wallet]`)
  - List all profiles with skill filtering
  - Individual profile view with asks/offers
  - Profile links from network page
  
- ✅ **Request a meeting time**
  - Session library functions (create, list, get, confirm, reject)
  - Session API route (`/api/sessions`)
  - Request meeting modal component
  - Request meeting button on profile pages
  
- ✅ **Confirm meeting time**
  - Sessions list page (`/me/sessions`) with status grouping
  - Confirm/reject buttons for pending sessions
  - Session confirmation API integration
  - **Jitsi link display** (FIXED - now working correctly)
  
- ✅ **Jitsi link generation on confirmation**
  - Auto-generated when both parties confirm
  - Displayed on scheduled sessions page
  - **Fixed query logic** - now queries per session key for reliability

---

## 🔧 Recent Fix: Jitsi Link Display

**Problem:** Jitsi links weren't appearing even though entities existed in Arkiv.

**Root Cause:** Query logic was fetching all Jitsi entities then filtering, which missed matches.

**Solution:** Changed to query Jitsi entities directly by `sessionKey` for each session.

**Result:** ✅ Jitsi links now appear correctly for sessions with both confirmations.

See `docs/JITSI_FIX_SUMMARY.md` for full details.

## 🐛 Known Issues / Technical Debt

   - Common on Mendoza testnet
   - Handled gracefully with user-friendly messages
   - Entities are created, just waiting for confirmation

2. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Basic responsive structure in place
   - Needs full mobile optimization pass (P4)

3. **Ethereum Passkey**
   - Deferred to end of sprint
   - Placeholder exists in `lib/auth/passkey.ts`

## 🚀 Ready for Beta?

**Core Features:** ✅ Yes (P0, P1, P2 core complete)  
**Polish:** ⚠️ Needs P4 polish pass  
**Deployment:** ⚠️ Needs Vercel deployment setup

**Recommendation:** Complete paid flow (P2), then proceed to P4 polish before beta launch.
