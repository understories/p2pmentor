- ~~Explorer doesn't displays Asks/Offers. Under All Types, it displays the lite_offer and lite_ask entities~~ FIXED: EntityCard now handles lite_ask/lite_offer with proper content display, readable badge labels, and API filtering groups them with asks/offers
- ~~On https://p2pmentor.com/learner-quests/ is difficult to click the Submit Answer / Next buttons given the overlay of icons. Maybe these icons could come up only when the cursor clicks one circle in the corner instead of six.~~ FIXED: Floating buttons now collapse behind a single +/x toggle button; users click to expand
- ~~Are entities being created when I click Submit? If these are entities, they are not showing on the explorer.~~ FIXED: Yes, entities are created (meta_learning_artifact for quest steps, learner_quest_progress for assessment answers). They now show in the explorer with a "Quest Progress" filter option.
- ~~I noticed that if I click Next instead of submitting first, when I click Previous the button says Submitting... Commenting in case that's not intended.~~ FIXED: handleNext now awaits the submission before navigating, so the Submitting... state clears before the user can go back.
