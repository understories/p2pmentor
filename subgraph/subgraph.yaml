# Mentorship Subgraph Manifest
# 
# Placeholder manifest for The Graph subgraph indexing Arkiv entities.
# 
# Reference: docs/graph_indexing_plan.md
# 
# TODO: This is a scaffold. Actual implementation requires:
# 1. Arkiv event/call data source configuration
# 2. Network configuration (OP Stack / Mendoza testnet)
# 3. Event handlers in src/mappings/
# 4. Deployment configuration (local Graph Node or hosted service)
#
# For now, this file documents the intended structure but does not build or deploy.

# TODO: Configure data sources based on Arkiv contract events
# Arkiv entities are created via contract calls, so we need to:
# - Identify the Arkiv contract address on Mendoza testnet
# - Map entity creation events/calls to subgraph entities
# - Handle entity updates and expiration
dataSources: []
  # Example structure (not yet implemented):
  # - kind: ethereum/contract
  #   name: ArkivContract
  #   network: mendoza  # or OP Stack network identifier
  #   source:
  #     address: "0x..."  # Arkiv contract address
  #     abi: ArkivContract
  #   mapping:
  #     kind: ethereum/events
  #     apiVersion: 0.0.7
  #     language: wasm/assemblyscript
  #     entities:
  #       - Profile
  #       - Ask
  #       - Offer
  #       - Session
  #       - Feedback
  #     abis:
  #       - name: ArkivContract
  #         file: ./abis/ArkivContract.json
  #     eventHandlers:
  #       - event: EntityCreated(indexed bytes32,indexed bytes32)
  #         handler: handleEntityCreated
