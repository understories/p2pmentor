# p2pmentor

Planting the first beta seed of peer to peer mentorship.

Teach, learn, and mentor without intermediaries.  
Own your data.  
Let knowledge and growth light the path through the dark forest.

p2pmentor is the beta launch built on top of Mentor Graph, moving toward the larger vision of a living, growing Mentor Garden.  
This release focuses on core mentorship flows and a clean developer experience with Arkiv as the data layer.

## What this project is

A small, focused beta of a peer to peer mentorship network.  
Built on Arkiv so users can own their data.  
Designed with the dark forest and hidden garden aesthetics from our earlier work.

## What this project is not

Production ready.  
A place to use wallets with real funds.  
A full version of a mentorship platform.

## Development notes

Developer experience updates for Arkiv live in `/docs/dx_arkiv_runbook.md`.  
This beta is intentionally small so we can ship quickly and learn from real usage.
